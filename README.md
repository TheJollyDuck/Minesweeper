# Minesweeper

This is a hobby project I've been working on trying to re-create the classic of Minesweeper with slight modifications here and there.

- [Get Python Here](https://www.python.org/) (Tkinter is used)
- [PyCharm if you want a dedicated Python IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)

## About Game
The game can either be played using the console version or the Tkinter version, which you will be prompted in the console when launched. The Tkinter version uses a GUI which doesn't use the console prompts.

The game has only been tested on Python 3.8 but probably work fine with other 3.x versions.

##Future Plans

The project is still in its early stage and I hope to implement various features once the base idea is implemented.

These plans include:

- Customizable grid sizes
- Leaderboard
- An .exe executable of the program so that Python would no longer be necessary
